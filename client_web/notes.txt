Feature: List of Game Current Status

When you click on a game, and it runs, the list of games will say that it is running that game. 
If they try to run another game, it will say, "you are already running a game."
If it isn't running a game, it will say, "please select which game you'd like to play."

status: ready  not running a game
status: running a game
status: not connected to the launcher locally not connected

currently:
onclick game --> start game()

what we want:
onclick game --> start game(), redirect to new page, with game photo,
    saying "You are currently running ${fullgame.name}."



now we need to onclick game showStatus()

showStatus(){
    render(){
        return(
            className="status"
            <span> {this.props.isRunning} </span>

        )

        if(isRunning)
        {
            return "This computer is already running ${fullGame.name}."
        }

        else
        {
            return "Please select a game you'd like to play."
        }
    }
}
